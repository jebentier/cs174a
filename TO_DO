So as you can probably see I changed up the file structure a bit:

index.php - login page
main.php  - the main user page
admin.php - manager page stuff

The user functions are more or less filled out, but I haven't tested them
yet and I know for sure that I'm gonna need to make a few changes. Issues like
handling printer usage, changing the global system time, and finishing up the
manager functions are some things I still need to do.

I have all the backend more or less figured out in my head, so I can finish that up.


If you wanna fill out some more of the page markups and/or fill the database with the
test data from the class page, that'd be great!
